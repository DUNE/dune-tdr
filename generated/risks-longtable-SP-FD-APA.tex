\caption[APA risks]{APA risks (P=probability, C=cost, S=schedule) The risk probability, after taking into account the planned mitigation activities, is ranked as 
L (low $<\,$\SI{10}{\%}), 
M (medium \SIrange{10}{25}{\%}), or 
H (high $>\,$\SI{25}{\%}). 
The cost and schedule impacts are ranked as 
L (cost increase $<\,$\SI{5}{\%}, schedule delay $<\,$\num{2} months), 
M (\SIrange{5}{25}{\%} and 2--6 months, respectively) and 
H ($>\,$\SI{20}{\%} and $>\,$2 months, respectively). \fixmehl{ref \texttt{tab:risks:DP-FD-CISC}}} \\
