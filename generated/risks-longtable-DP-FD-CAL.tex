ID & Risk & Mitigation & P & C & S  \\  \colhline
RT-DP-CAL-01 & Inadequate baseline design & Early detection allows R\&D of alternative designs accommodated through multipurpose ports. & L & M & M \\  \colhline
RT-DP-CAL-02 & Inadequate engineering or production quality & Dedicated small-scale tests and full prototyping at ProtoDUNE; pre-installation QC. & L & M & M \\  \colhline
RT-DP-CAL-03 & Laser impact on PDS & Mirror movement control to minimize direct hits; intelock to keep laser off while PMTs are on. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-CAL-04 & Laser positioning system stops working & QC at installation time, redundancy in available targets, including passive, alternative methods. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-CAL-05 & Laser beam misaligned & Additional (visible) laser for alignment purposes. & M & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-CAL-06 & The neutron anti-resonance is much less pronounced & Dedicated measurements at LANL and test at ProtoDUNE. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-CAL-07 & Neutron activation of the moderator and cryostat & Neutron activation studies and simulations. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-CAL-08 & Neutron yield not high enough & Simulations and tests at ProtoDUNE; alternative, movable design & L & M & M \\  \colhline
RO-DP-CAL-09 & Laser beam is stable at longer distances than designed & tests at ProtoDUNE & M & H & L \\  \colhline
