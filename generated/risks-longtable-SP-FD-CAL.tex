\caption[Calibration risks]{Calibration risks (P=probability, C=cost, S=schedule) The risk probability, after taking into account the planned mitigation activities, is ranked as 
L (low $<\,$\SI{10}{\%}), 
M (medium \SIrange{10}{25}{\%}), or 
H (high $>\,$\SI{25}{\%}). 
The cost and schedule impacts are ranked as 
L (cost increase $<\,$\SI{5}{\%}, schedule delay $<\,$\num{2} months), 
M (\SIrange{5}{25}{\%} and 2--6 months, respectively) and 
H ($>\,$\SI{20}{\%} and $>\,$2 months, respectively).  \fixmehl{ref \texttt{tab:risks:SP-FD-CAL}}} \\

ID & Risk & Mitigation & P & C & S  \\  \colhline
RT-SP-CAL-01 & Inadequate baseline design & Early detection allows R\&D of alternative designs accommodated through multipurpose ports & L & M & M \\  \colhline
RT-SP-CAL-02 & Inadequate engineering or production quality & Dedicated small scale tests and full prototyping at ProtoDUNE; pre-installation QC & L & M & M \\  \colhline
RT-SP-CAL-03 & Laser impact on PDS & Mirror movement control to avoid direct hits; turn laser off in case of PDS saturation & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-CAL-04 & Laser beam location system stops working & QC at installation time, redundancy in available targets, including passive, alternative methods & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-CAL-05 & Laser beam misaligned & Additional (visible) laser for alignment purposes & M & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-CAL-06 & The neutron anti-resonance is much less pronounced & Dedicated measurements at LANL and test at ProtoDUNE & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-CAL-07 & Neutron activation of the moderator and cryostat & Neutron activation studies and simulations & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-CAL-08 & Neutron yield not high enough & Simulations and tests at ProtoDUNE; alternative, movable design & L & M & M \\  \colhline
RO-SP-CAL-09 & Laser beam is stable at longer distances than designed & tests at ProtoDUNE & M & H & L \\  \colhline
