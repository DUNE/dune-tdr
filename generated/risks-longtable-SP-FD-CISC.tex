\caption[CISC risks]{CISC risks (P=probability, C=cost, S=schedule) The risk probability, after taking into account the planned mitigation activities, is ranked as 
L (low $<\,$\SI{10}{\%}), 
M (medium \SIrange{10}{25}{\%}), or 
H (high $>\,$\SI{25}{\%}). 
The cost and schedule impacts are ranked as 
L (cost increase $<\,$\SI{5}{\%}, schedule delay $<\,$\num{2} months), 
M (\SIrange{5}{25}{\%} and 2--6 months, respectively) and 
H ($>\,$\SI{20}{\%} and $>\,$2 months, respectively).  \fixmehl{ref \texttt{tab:risks:SP-FD-CISC}}} \\

ID & Risk & Mitigation & P & C & S  \\  \colhline
RT-SP-CISC-01 & Baseline design from ProtoDUNEs for an instrumentation device is not adequate for DUNE far detectors & Focus on early problem discovery in ProtoDUNE so any needed redesigns can start as soon as possible. & L & M & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-CISC-02 & Swinging of long instrumentation devices (T-gradient monitors or PrM system) & Add additional intermediate constraints to prevent swinging. & L & L & L \\  \colhline

RT-SP-CISC-09 & Difficulty correlating purity and temperature in ProtoDUNE-SP impairs understanding cryo system. & Identify causes of discrepancy, modify design. Calibrate PrM differences, correlate with RTDs. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-CISC-10 & Cold camera R\&D fails to produce prototype meeting specifications \& safety requirements & Improve insulation and heaters. Use cameras in ullage or inspection cameras instead. & M & M & L \\  \colhline
