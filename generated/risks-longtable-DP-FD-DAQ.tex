ID & Risk & Mitigation & P & C & S  \\  \colhline
RT-DP-DAQ-01 & Detector noise specs not met & ProtoDUNE experience with noise levels and provisions for data processing redundancy in DAQ system; ensure enough headroom of bandwidth to FNAL. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-DAQ-02 & Externally-driven schedule change & Provisions for standalone testing and commissioning of production DAQ components, and schedule adjustment & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-DAQ-03 & Lack of expert personnel & Resource-loaded plan for DAQ backed by institutional commitments, and schedule adjustment using float & L & L & H \\  \colhline
RT-DP-DAQ-04 & Power/space requirements exceed CUC capacity & Sufficient bandwidth to surface and move module 3/4 components to an expanded surface facility & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-DAQ-05 & Excess fake trigger rate from instrumental effects & ProtoDUNE performance experience, and provisions for increase in event builder and high level filter capacity, as needed; headroom in data link to FNAL. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-DAQ-06 & Calibration requirements exceed acceptable data rate & Provisions for increase in event builder and high level filter capacity, as neeed; headroom in data link to FNAL. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
