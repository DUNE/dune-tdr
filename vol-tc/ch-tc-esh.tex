\chapter{Environment, Safety, and Health}
\label{vl:tc-ESH}


A strong \dword{esh} program is essential to successfully complete
\dword{lbnf} and \dword{dune} at \dword{surf} and hosted by \fnal.
\dword{lbnf-dune} is internationally designed, coordinated and funded
through collaborating laboratories and universities.  \dword{lbnf}
comprises the world's highest intensity neutrino beam at \fnal and the
infrastructure necessary to support the large cryogenic experimental
detectors at \dword{surf}.

\dword{lbnf-dune} is committed to protecting the health and safety of
staff, the community and the environment, as stated in the
\dword{lbnf-dune} integrated \dword{esh} plan, as well as ensuring a
safe work environment for \dword{dune} workers at all institutions and
protecting the public from hazards associated with constructing and
operating \dword{dune}. Accidents and injuries are preventable, and
the \dword{esh} team will work with the global \dword{lbnf-dune}
project and collaboratioon to establish a workplace free of injuries.
All work will be performed so that the quality of the environment is
preserved, and property damage prevented.

The \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} program complies with applicable
standards and local, state, federal and international legal
requirements through the \fnal work smart set of standards and the
contract between Fermi Research Alliance (FRA) and the \dword{doe}
Office of Science (FRA-DOE). \fnal, as the host laboratory,
established the \dword{sdsd} to provide facility support.
\dword{sdsd} is responsible for support of \dword{lbnf-dune}
operations at \dword{surf}.

The \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} program strives to prevent
injuries or illness and seeks to continually improve safety and health
management.  To the maximum practical extent, all hazards must be
eliminated or minimized through substitution, engineering or
administrative controls.  Where engineering or administrative controls
are not feasible, \dword{ppe} will be used.

The \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} management system is
designed to work hand in hand with the \dword{surf} emergency
management systems to protect the public, workers and environment;
ensure compliance with the FRA-DOE contract and \fnal Work Smart
standards; and improve the \dword{dune} ability to meet or
exceed stakeholder expectations and execute the
scientific mission.  \dword{dune} uses a set of criteria to plan, direct,
control, coordinate, assure and improve how \dword{esh} policies,
objectives, processes and procedures are established, implemented,
monitored and achieved.

The \dword{lbnf} facilities at \dword{surf} are subject to
the requirements of the \dword{doe} Worker Safety and Health Program,
Title 10, Code Federal Regulations, Part 851 (10 CFR 851). These
requirements are promulgated through the {\it \fnal Director Policy
Manual}\footnote{\fnal Director's Policy Manual is:
  http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/Policy\_Manual.html}, and the {\it \fnal
\dword{esh} Manual}\footnote{\fnal \dword{esh} Manual is:
  http://esh.fnal.gov/xms/ESHQ-Manuals/feshm} (\dword{feshm}), which
align with the \dword{surf} \dword{esh} Manual.


\section{\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} Management and Oversight}

The \dword{tcoord} and \dword{ipd} have responsibility for
implementation of the \dword{dune} \dword{esh} program.  The
\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} manager reports directly to the
\dword{tcoord} and \dword{ipd} and is responsible for providing
\dword{esh} support and oversight for development and implementation
\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} program. Figure~\ref{fig:dune_esh} shows
the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} organization.


The \dword{dune} \dword{esh} coordinator reports to the
\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} manager and has primary responsibility
for \dword{esh} support and oversight of the \dword{dune} \dword{esh}
program for activities at collaborating insitutions as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:dune_esh_construction}.  The far and near site
\dword{esh} coordinators are responsible for providing daily field support and
oversight for all installation activities at the \dword{surf}
and \dword{fnal} sites as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dune_esh_installation}.

Additional \dword{esh} Subject Matter Experts (SME) are available to
provide supplemental support to the project through the \fnal
\dword{esh} Section. The \fnal \dword{esh} Section, FRA-DOE, CERN and
\dword{surf} will provide supplemental \dword{esh} oversight to
validate implementation of the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh}
program. FRA-DOE maintains daily oversight presence at the far and
near sites.

The \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} Plan defines the \dword{esh}
requirements applicable to installation activities at the \dword{surf}
site. Regular \dword{esh} walkthroughs will be conducted by
\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} management personnel. All
findings will be documented utilizing the \fnal Predictive Solutions
database system.

\section{National Environmental Protection Act Compliance}

In compliance with the National Environmental Protection Act and in
accordance with \dword{doe} Policy 451.1, the
\dword{lbnf-dune} project performed an evaluation of potential
environmental impacts during construction and operation of the
project.  An environmental assessment has been prepared on the
potential environmental impacts and the safety and health hazards
identified during the design, construction, and operating phases of
\dword{lbnf-dune}.  The environmental assessment presented an
analysis of the potential environmental consequences of the facility
and compared them to the consequences of a No Action Alternative. The
assessment included detailed analysis of all potential environmental,
safety, and health hazards associated with construction and operation
of the facility.  The environmental assessment has been completed and
a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) issued in September 2015.

\section{Codes/Standards Equivalencies}
\label{sec:esh_codes}

\dword{dune} will rely on significant contributions from international
partners. In many cases, an international partner will contribute
equipment for installation at \dword{fnal} or \dword{surf} built
following international standards. \dword{fnal} has established a
process under the international agreement with \dword{cern}, detailed
in \dword{feshm} Chapter 2110, to establish code equivalency between
USA and international engineering design codes and standards. This
process allows the laboratory to accept in kind contributions from
international partners or purchase equipment designed using
international standards while ensuring an equivalent level
of safety.

At the time of this writing, \fnal has completed the following code
equivalencies:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Pressure vessels designed using EN13445,
 \item Structures designed using EN 1990, EN 1991, EN1993, EN 1999 (a
   subset of the Eurocodes), and EN 14620;
 \item CE-marked pressure piping systems designed using PED 97/23 EN 13480;
 \item CE-marked relief valves designed using PED 2014/68/EU EN ISO 4126;
 \item CE-marked electrical equipment for measurement, control and
   laboratory use designed using IEC 61010-1 and IEC 61010-2-030.
\end{itemize}

As necessary, the laboratory code equivalency process will be followed
to establish equivalency to other international codes and
standards. The current list of completed code equivalencies can be
found in the \dword{esh}Q Section Document Database DocDB-3303\footnote{https://esh-docdbcert.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/cert/ShowDocument?docid=3303}.


\section{\dword{esh} Requirements at Collaborating Laboratories and Institutions}

All work performed at collaborating institutions will be completed
following that institution's \dword{esh} policies and
programs. Equipment and operating procedures provided by the
collaborating institution will conform to the \dword{dune} project
\dword{esh} and integrated safety management policies and
procedures. The \dword{esh} organization at collaborating institutions
provides \dword{esh} oversight for work activities carried
out at their facilities.
%\dword{lbnf-dune} personnel will also follow the \dword{esh} manual and procedures at the collaborating institutions.

\section{\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} Program at \dword{surf}}

\subsection{Site and Facility Access}

All \dword{dune} workers requiring access to the \dword{surf} site
register through the \fnal Global Services Office to receive the
necessary user training and a \fnal identification number that can be
used to apply for a \dword{surf} identification badge, through the
\dword{surf} Administrative Services Office. This is coordinated by
\dword{sdsd}. The \dword{surf} identification badge allows access to
the \dword{surf} site as part of the \dword{surf} Site Access Control
Program. The \fnal Global Services Office has extensive experience
with international collaborators.


\dword{surf} underground access will require that working groups
obtain a trip action plan (TAP) for each daily access to the
underground areas.  All personnel within each working group must be
individually listed on the trip action plan, per the \dword{surf} Site
Access Control Program. All personnel are required to ``brass in and
out'' via the brass board located at the entrance to the Ross Shaft
cage prior to accessing the underground facilities.

\subsection{\dword{esh} Training}

All \dword{dune} collaborators, as part of registration through the \fnal Users office,
will complete the user \dword{esh} training modules and the supervisor
will complete a training needs assessment to develop a training plan
to define additional \dword{dune} \dword{esh} training requirements.

All personal performing work onsite at \dword{surf} are required to
attend \dword{surf} \dword{esh} Site Orientation prior to their work
at the site.  This includes \dword{surf} Surface and Underground
training classes, as well as associated Cultural Heritage
training. Arrangements will be made for all workers to complete this
training. In addition, unescorted access training will be provided to
personnel for each underground working level (4850L and 4910L) at
which they will perform work.  The \dword{lbnf}/\dword{dune}
\dword{esh} management team will present a project-specific
introductory \dword{esh} presentation.

\subsection{Personnel Protective Equipment}

Personal protective equipment (PPE) is not a substitute for
engineering and administrative controls. These controls shall be
implemented, to the extent feasible, to mitigate the hazard so that
the need for PPE is reduced or eliminated.

Personnel shall wear the following PPE when on site the \dword{surf} site.
\begin{itemize}
\item At a minimum, all workers personnel shall wear
  steel-toed boots, long pants and shirts with 4~inch sleeves when
  performing non-office work at \dword{surf}. 
  \item All personnel entering the work site at the Ross (or Yates) Dry
    shall wear hard hats (brim facing forward), gloves,
    safety glasses with rigid side-shields and reflective high
    visibility (e.g., orange) shirt/coat/vest (minimum ANSI Class 2).
    Exceptions to these minimum requirements shall be approved by the
    \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} manager and noted in the
    activity-specific \dword{ha} maintained by the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} coordinator.
  \item When working underground, all personnel will carry an Ocenco M20.2 self rescuer
    and a hard hat cap lamp. In addition, Ocenco 7.5 emergency breathing apparatus devices
    will be stored underground for additional emergency support.
  \item Hard hats shall meet the ANSI Z89.1 standard as defined by 29
    CFR 1926.100 and bear the {\em Z89-.1} designation.
   \item Eye protection must meet the requirement of 29 CFR
      1926.102. Safety glasses must be ANSI approved and be marked
      with the ANSI marking {\em Z87.1} designation.
    \item Hearing protection appropriate to the work environment, as
      defined in the activity-based \dword{ha}.
    \item Any specialized PPE required for specific work tasks as
      defined in the activity-based \dword{ha}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Work Planning and Controls}

The goal of the work planning and hazard analysis process is to
initiate careful thought about the hazards associated with work and
how it can be performed safely. Careful planning of a job assures that
it is performed efficiently and safely. Work planning ensures the
scope of the job is understood, appropriate materials are available,
all hazards have been identified, mitigation efforts established, and
all affected employees understand what is expected of them. Hazard
analysis is a critical part of work planning. All work activities
shall be subject to work planning and hazard analysis. Depending on
the complexity of the task and the hazards involved, the HA process
may be a mental exercise and verbal discussion, or it may be more
formal with a written hazard analysis and pre-job briefing. The Work
Planning and Hazard Analysis program is documented in Chapters 2060 in
the FESHM. All work planning documentation will be reviewed and
approved by \dword{dune} \dword{esh} coordinator and the \dword{dune}
\dword{irr} or \dword{orr} committees prior to the start of work activities.

A Work Planning Meeting shall be held each day/shift prior to the
start of daily work activities. The meeting(s) should be led by the
shift supervisor, supported by the \dword{dune} \dword{esh} coordinator and
attended by all personnel working onsite that day. The duration of
the meetings is based on the activities occurring that day and
typically last approximately fifteen minutes. The daily planning
meetings should inform the workers of potential safety hazards and
hazard mitigations relating to the various work activities, ensure
that employees have the necessary \dword{esh} training and PPE, answer any
questions relating to the work activities and authorize the work
activities for that day.

A Safety Data Sheet (SDS) will be available for all chemicals and
hazardous materials that are used on site. All chemicals and hazardous
materials brought to the \dword{surf} site must be reviewed/approved by the
\dword{dune} \dword{esh} coordinator and the \dword{surf} \dword{esh}
Department before arriving at site.  SDS documentation should be
submitted to the \dword{dune} \dword{esh} coordinator prior to the
material arriving on site.

\subsection{Emergency Management}

Any injuries, accident or spill will be reported immediately to the
\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} manager, from either the \dword{surf}
Emergency Response Coordinator or the installation manager, through the
\dword{dune} far site \dword{esh} coordinators and the \dword{dune}
\dword{esh} coordinator. All personnel that experience any injury will be
sent or transported to the Black Hills Medical Clinic or Regional Health
Lead-Deadwood hospital as appropriate.  The supervisor shall complete an
initial incident investigation report and submit the report to the
\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} manager within 24 hours.

The {\it \dword{surf} \dword{esh}
Manual}\footnote{http://sanfordlab.org/esh} maintains the {\it Emergency
Management and Emergency Response Plan}
(ERP)\footnote{http://sanfordlab.org/esh/manual/32-emergency-response-plan-erp-policy}
for the site. All personnel will receive ERP training and the ERP
flowchart for emergency notification process is posted at all
telephones. For all emergencies at the \dword{surf} site, personnel
shall contact Emergency Response personnel by utilizing any building
phone, dialing the hoist operator or by calling 911 from any outside
line (cell phone).

Emergency Response Groups that are not part of SURF but are recognized
outside resources are Lawrence County Emergency Manager, Lead and
Deadwood Fire Departments, Lawrence County Search and Rescue, Black
Hills Life Flight, and Rapid City Fire Department HAZMAT team. The
\dword{surf} ERP is distributed to these resources to facilitate outside
emergency response.

\dword{sdsta} will maintain an Emergency Response incident command
system and an \dword{ert} on all shifts that are able to access the
underground sites with normal surface fire department response
times. This team provides multiple response capabilities for both
surface and underground emergencies but specializes in underground
rescue through MSHA Metal/Non-Metal Mine Rescue training. The
\dword{ert} has a defined training schedule, conduct regular
walkthroughs in areas of response and emergency drills are conducted
on both the surface and underground sites, for which all personnel on
site are required to participate. \dword{ert} personnel includes a
minimum of one emergency medical technician (EMT) and/or Paramedic per
shift.

\dword{surf} implements a guide program for both the surface and
underground areas. The guide program has an established training
program. Guides are required to escort visitors/untrained personnel on
the \dword{surf} site. The underground guide program requires at a
minimum one guide on each working level underground to provide
supplemental emergency support to unescorted access trained
personnel. Guides are trained as first responders to help in a medical
emergency until the ERT arrives.

In the case of an underground emergency such as fire or \dword{odh},
evacuation to the surface will be through the Ross or Yates Shafts,
but if evacuation is not fully possible the refuge chamber on the 4850
level can shelter up to 144 persons for 98 hours.

\subsection{Fire Protection, \dword{odh} and Life Safety}

The \dword{dune} installation team shall police their work areas
frequently and maintain good housekeeping. Common garbage and other
waste shall be disposed of at frequent and regular intervals by the
teams generating the waste. Containers shall be provided for the
collection and separation of waste, trash, oily or used rags and other
refuse.  Containers used for garbage and other oily, flammable, or
hazardous wastes, (such as caustics, acids, harmful dusts or similar
materials) shall be equipped with covers.  Chemical agents or
substances, which might react to create a hazardous condition, shall
be stored and disposed of separately as assessed by the
\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} coordinator.

Chemicals and hazardous materials must be in proper storage cabinets
with SDS documentation readily available as collected by the
\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} coordinator. The
\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} coordinator will evaluate
appropriate storage cabinets for the \dword{ipd}.

\fnal hot work permits shall be completed and approved for all open
flame, welding, cutting or grinding work activities.  The \dword{dune}
\dword{esh} coordinator will coordinate the issuance of the permit.
The team completing the work will be responsible for
providing all the required materials, personnel and protective
equipment to conduct all hot work. All hot work permits shall be
provided to the \dword{surf} \dword{esh} Department.

Cables installed for \dword{dune} are chosen to be
consistent with current \fnal standards for cable insulation and
comply with recognized standards concerning cable fire resistance
reducing the probability of a fire starting and health effects of
combustion products of cable insulation materials.

Fire and life safety requirements for \dword{lbnf-dune} areas were
analyzed in the {\it \dword{lbnf-dune} Far Site Fire and Life Safety
  Assessment}~\citedocdb{14245}. ARUP provided code analysis, fire
modeling, egress calculations, and the design of the fire protection
features for \dword{lbnf} far site facilities.  Additionally, the ARUP
consultant SRK Consulting, modeled additional fire scenarios and the
spread of toxic fumes and heat in the drifts utilized by
\dword{lbnf-dune} for evacuation.  All caverns will be equipped with
fire detection and suppression systems with both visual and audible
notification.  All fire alarms and system supervisory signals will be
monitored in the \dword{surf} Incident Command Center.  The
\dword{surf} \dword{ert} will respond with additional support from the
Lead-Deadwood Fire Departments and county’s emergency management
department.

\dword{odh} requirements were assessed through the {\it \dword{lbnf-dune}
\dword{odh} Analysis}. The caverns have been classified as ODH 1 and
the drifts are classified as ODH 0. The caverns will be equipped with
an \dword{odh} monitoring and alarm system with independent visual and
audible notification systems.  All \dword{odh} alarms and system
supervisory signals will be monitored in the \dword{surf} Incident
Command Center.  Each occupant entering an ODH area will receive ODH
training and carry Ocenco M20.3 escape packs.

Emergency conditions from smoke or \dword{odh} incidents underground are
primarily mitigated by the large ventillation rate in the \dword{surf}
underground area.

The facility emergency management plan will be reviewed and updated as
necessary during construction, installation, and operation activities
based on the egress strategy defined in the ARUP Fire and Safety
Report and the {\it \dword{surf} Emergency Management
  Plan}\footnote{http://sanfordlab.org/ehs/manual/31-emergency-management-policy}.

Radon levels are presently monitored in the occupied underground
facilities. This monitoring program will extend to the \dword{lbnf}
underground areas in coordination with \dword{fnal} and \dword{sdsta}
\dword{esh} personnel.

\subsection{Earthquake Design Standards}

For surface and underground structures the design standard is the
latest edition of the International Building Code (IBC) (2018).
Chapter 16 of IBC is Structural Design, and Section 1613 is Earthquake
Loads. The Lead seismic region, according to the American Society of
Civil Engineers (ASCE 7), is between the the lowest risk (same as
seismic region for \fnal) and the next level up. Both are minimal
risks.

\subsection{Material handling and Equipment Operation}

All overhead cranes, gantry cranes, fork lifts, motorized equipment,
e.g., trains and carts, will be operated only by trained
operators. Other equipment, e.g., scissor lifts, pallet jacks, hand
tools and shop equipment, will be operated only by personnel trained
for the particular piece of equipment. 

Hoisting and rigging operations shall be evaluated and planned.  A
member of the trained rigging team shall identify the hazards and
determine the controls necessary to maintain an acceptable level of
risk.  A Hoisting and Rigging Lift Plan is required for complex and
critical lifts. This plan shall be documented using the \fnal Hoisting
and Rigging Lift Plan or similar plan accepted by \fnal. The Hazard
Analysis documentation will include the development of critical lift
plans for specific phases of installation activities.

All equipment operating in the underground facility will be diesel or
electric powered. There will be no gasoline or propane powered
equipment in the underground facility. Diesel is allowed due to the large
ventillation rate in the underground area.

\subsection{Stop Work Authority}

If unanticipated/unsafe conditions are identified or non-compliant
practices are observed during construction activities, workers should
recognize that the work activity in which they are engaged should be
stopped and notify their supervisor and \dword{esh} officer of
this action. All workers on the \dword{dune} project have the
authority to stop work in any situation that presents an imminent
threat to safety, health and the environment. Work may not resume
until the circumstances are investigated and deficiencies corrected,
including the concurrence of the \dword{dune} \dword{ipd}
and \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} manager.

\subsection{Operational Readiness}

The \dword{dune} review process consists of design, production,
installation and operation reviews as described in
Chapter~\ref{vl:tc-review}. These reviews include lifting fixture
load testing and work planning and controls documentation. The
\dword{jpo} Review Office is involved at all stages of the review
process. All major stakeholders (including \fnal, \dword{surf} and
\dword{dune} collaborating institutions) will be involved as
appropriate. The Review Office will complete both system and process
readiness reviews to authorize installation activities at
\dword{surf}.  Prior to operation of detector components operational
readiness reviews will be completed.

\subsection{Lessons Learned}

The \dword{lbnf} Project is currently working with \dword{sdsta} and the 
engineering consultant ARUP to implement \dword{esh} procedures and
protocols for training, emergency management, fire
protection and life safety. The \fnal \dword{esh} Section, DOE and
\dword{lbnf} \dword{esh} have completed a series of assessments of
critical \dword{sdsta} \dword{esh} programs including underground access,
emergency management, electrical safety, rigging and fire
protection. The findings and lessons learned identified in these
\dword{esh} program assessments are tracked within the \fnal issues management
database --- iTrack.

\fnal completed a review to
identify critical lessons learned from the previous underground
neutrino project NuMI/MINOS Project in May 2009. The findings from this
exercise were documented in a report entitled Executive Summary of
Major NuMI Lessons Learned.  \dword{dune} lessons learned from
\dword{protodune} are being utilized to further develop and enhance
the \dword{dune} engineering review and work planning and controls
processes.

Lessons learned are disseminated in areas of applicability and
flowed-down for appropriate implementation. Any action items
associated with lessons learned are tracked in iTrack. Lessons learned
are reviewed and evaluated by both \fnal and \dword{lbnf-dune} management.

The \dword{lbnf} Project is presently implementing \dword{esh}
programs required for site access, training, work planning and
emergency management for construction activities on the \dword{surf}
site. During the implementation of these program lessons learned will
be identified and addressed to improve the implementation of the \dword{lbnf-dune}
\dword{esh} programs.  The \dword{esh} programs will be fully
established and implemented when \dword{dune} activities start at
\dword{surf}.
