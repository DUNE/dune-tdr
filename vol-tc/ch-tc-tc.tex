\chapter{Detector Design and Construction Organization}
\label{vl:tc-overview}

The \dword{dune} \dword{fd} construction project refers collectively 
to the activities associated with the design and construction of 
necessary detector components.  \dword{dune} collaboration management 
is responsible for overseeing this portion of the \dword{lbnf-dune} and 
ensuring its successful execution.  The high-level \dword{dune} 
collaboration management team consisting of the co-spokespersons, 
\dword{tcoord}, and \dword{rcoord} is responsible for the
management of the project.  

\section{\dshort{dune} Consortia}
\label{sec:consortia}

Construction of the \dword{dune} far \dwords{detmodule} is carried out by 
consortia of collaboration institutions who assume responsibility 
for detector subsystems.  Each consortium plans and executes the 
construction, installation, and commissioning of its subsystem.

Management of each consortium is through an overall consortium leader 
and a technical lead.  The consortium leader chairs an institutional 
board composed of one representative from each of the collaborating 
institutions contributing to the activities of the consortium.  Major 
consortium decisions such as technology selections and assignment of 
responsibilities within the institutions should pass %are expected to be passed 
through its institutional board.  These decisions are then passed 
as recommendations to the \dword{dune} \dword{exb}, as described in 
greater detail below, for formal collaboration approval.

Figure~\ref{fig:DUNE_consortia_org} shows an example consortium 
organizational chart incorporating the basic structures mandated 
by \dword{dune} collaboration management.  In addition to the pieces 
described above, consortia in most cases need to manage the design 
and construction of subsystem deliverables that are supported by 
multiple funding agencies.  In the sample case illustrated here, 
responsibilities for subsystem deliverables are shared between the 
USA, UK, and Switzerland (CH), where each of the funding agencies 
is expected to manage its own internal projects with responsibility 
for different sets of assigned deliverables.  To ensure coordination 
between the separate internal projects contributing to the consortia, 
technical leads are responsible for chairing consortium project 
management boards incorporating separate managers from each of 
the internal projects.   
\begin{dunefigure}[\dshort{dune} internal consortium structure]{fig:DUNE_consortia_org}
  {Sample \dword{dune} internal consortium structure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{graphics/Internal_Consortia_OrgChart2}
\end{dunefigure}

In addition to the mandated organizational pieces described here, 
the consortia incorporate additional internal structures as needed 
to deliver their assigned subsystems.  For example, working groups 
with convenors are typically appointed to focus on specific consortium 
activities, and steering committees are in many cases formed to help 
guide technical and strategic decisions within the consortia.  Each 
consortium is also expected to appoint both safety and \dword{qa} 
representatives as well as a representative with responsibility for 
integration and installation.  These individuals are charged 
with interacting  with the appropriate project support team 
personnel to ensure coordination in these areas across the consortia.        

\section{\dshort{dune} Collaboration Management}
\label{sec:dune_mgmt}

The high-level \dword{dune} collaboration management structure is 
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DUNE_org}.  The \dword{dune} \dword{exb} is 
the primary collaboration decision-making body and as such includes 
representatives from all major areas of activity within the 
collaboration.
\begin{dunefigure}[\dshort{dune} org chart]{fig:DUNE_org}
  {\dword{dune} Organizational Chart}
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{graphics/DUNE_Mgmt_20191001_v2}
\end{dunefigure}

Each consortium is represented on the \dword{dune} \dword{exb} by its 
consortium leader.  All collaboration decisions, especially those with 
potential impacts on the \dword{dune} scientific program or connected 
with the assignment of institutional responsibilities, pass through the 
\dword{exb}.  \dword{exb} decisions are made by  %expected to be achieved through 
consensus.  In cases where consensus cannot be obtained, decision-making 
responsibility passes to the co-spokespersons.

\section{Technical Coordination}
\label{sec:tc}

Because the consortia operate as self-managed entities, a strong
\dword{tc} organization is required to ensure overall integration 
of the detector elements and successful execution of the detector
construction project.  \Dword{tc} areas of responsibility include 
general project oversight, systems engineering, \dword{qa}, and 
safety.  \Dword{tc} also supports the planning and execution 
of integration and installation activities at \dword{surf} (see 
Chapter~\ref{ch:tc-jpo}).  

\Dword{tc} is headed by the \dword{tcoord},  a \dword{fnal}
employee appointed jointly by the \dword{fnal} director 
and the \dword{dune} co-spokespersons. % A deputy \dword{tcoord} is selected from within the collaboration to assist the \dword{tcoord} in carrying out their responsibilities.
A deputy \dword{tcoord}  selected from within the collaboration will assist the \dword{tcoord}.

The \dword{tcoord} manages the overall detector construction 
project through regular technical and project board meetings with 
the consortium leadership teams and members of the \dword{tc} 
organization (see Section~\ref{sec:tco}).  These board meetings 
are used to identify and resolve issues and serve as the primary 
fora for required interactions between the consortia.

Technical board meetings are used to evaluate consortia design
decisions with potential impacts on overall detector performance,
ensure that interfaces between the different subsystems are well
understood and documented, and monitor the overall construction
project to identify and address both technical and interface 
issues as they arise.

Project board meetings are used to ensure that the scopes of 
each consortium are fully documented with assigned institutional
responsibilities, develop and manage risks held within a global
project registry, review and manage project change requests, and
monitor the status of the overall detector construction schedule.

Any decisions generated through these board meetings are passed to 
the \dword{dune} \dword{exb} as recommendations for formal approval.
Depending on the agenda items to be discussed at a specific board
meeting, the \dword{tcoord} will invite additional members of the
collaboration with specific knowledge or particular expertise to
participate.  In addition, for major decisions, the \dword{tcoord}
will officially appoint internal collaboration referees with no associated 
conflicts of interest to %engage in the process of 
assist in evaluating the 
 technical issues behind these major decisions.

\section{Technical Coordination Organization}
\label{sec:tco}

The \dword{tcoord} heads an organization that supports the work of 
the consortia and has responsibility for a number of major project 
support functions prior to the delivery of detector components to 
\dword{surf} including
\begin{itemize}
\item ensuring that each consortium has a well defined and complete
  scope, that interactions between consortia are sufficiently 
  well defined, and that any missing scope outside of the 
  consortia is provided through other sources such as collaboration
  common funds;
\item defining and documenting scope boundaries and technical 
  interfaces both between consortia and with \dshort{lbnf};  
\item developing an overall schedule with appropriate dependencies
  between activities covering all phases of the project; 
\item ensuring that appropriate engineering and safety standards 
  are developed, understood, and agreed to by all key stakeholders 
  and that these standards are conveyed to and understood by each
  consortium;
\item ensuring that all \dword{dune} requirements on \dword{lbnf} 
  for \dword{fscf}, cryostat, and cryogenics are clearly defined and 
  agreed to by each consortium;
\item ensuring that each consortium has well developed and reviewed
  component designs, construction plans, \dword{qc} processes, and 
  safety programs; and
\item monitoring the overall project schedule and the progress of 
  each consortium towards delivering its assigned scope. 
\end{itemize}

The \dword{dune} \dword{tc} organizational structure is shown 
in Figure~\ref{fig:DUNE_tc}.  The structure incorporates teams 
with responsibilities for project coordination, engineering 
support, and installation interfaces.  Many \dword{tc} team 
members also contribute to the activities of the \dword{jpo} 
teams (shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DUNE_jpo}) in order to ensure 
coherence in project support functions across \dword{lbnf-dune}.
\begin{dunefigure}[\dshort{dune} technical coordination org chart]{fig:DUNE_tc}
  {\dword{dune} \dword{tc} organizational chart}
  \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{graphics/TC_OrgChart_v2}
\end{dunefigure}
 %%
The \dword{tc} project coordination team incorporates \dword{esh}, 
\dword{qa}, and project controls specialists.  Overall integration 
of the detector elements is coordinated through the \dword{tc} 
engineering support team headed by the \dword{lbnf-dune} systems 
engineer and lead \dword{dune} electrical engineer.  Planning 
coordinators for integration and installation activities at 
\dword{surf} sitting within the \dword{lbnf}/\dword{dune} \dword{integoff} also head the \dword{tc} installation interfaces team.  
The dual placement of these individuals facilitates the required 
coordination of integration and installation planning efforts between 
the core team directing these activities and the \dword{dune} 
consortia, which maintain primary responsibility for the individual 
detector subsystems.  Members of the \dword{tc} organization meet 
weekly to review project progress and discuss technical issues. 
     
Within the framework of the \dword{dune} \dword{fd} construction 
project, \dword{tc} project support functions associated with its 
coordination role include safety, engineering integration, change control, document management, scheduling, risk management, conducting reviews, and workflow. These functions are described in the following sections. 

\subsection{Safety}
\label{sec:tc_safety}

The \dword{tcoord} is responsible for implementing the safety program
covering the \dword{dune} construction project.  The \dword{tcoord} is
supported in this role by the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh}
manager.  A dedicated \dword{dune} \dword{esh} coordinator sits within
the \dword{tc} organization and guides the \dword{dune} safety program
under the direction of the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} manager. The
safety organization for the \dword{dune} construction project is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:dune_esh_construction} and is further described in
Chapter~\ref{vl:tc-ESH}.
\begin{dunefigure}[\dshort{dune} construction \dshort{esh}]{fig:dune_esh_construction}
  {High level \dword{dune} construction \dword{esh} organization.}
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{graphics/DUNE_Construction_Safety_OrgChart}
\end{dunefigure}

The \dword{dune} construction project is carried out at many different
institutions in many different countries.  Participating institutions
sign a \dword{mou} in which they agree to abide by the requirements of
the \dword{dune} safety program.  Each of the participating
institutions assumes primary responsibility for the safe execution of
their assigned construction activities.  The \dword{dune} \dword{esh}
coordinator interacts with all participating institutions to
ensure that their programs comply with \dword{dune} safety
requirements.  Prior to the start of any construction activities, the
\dword{dune} \dword{esh} coordinator participates in the \dword{prr}
incorporating on site visits to confirm that approved safety controls
are in place.  Follow-up on site visits by the \dword{dune} \dword{esh}
coordinator, including \dwords{ppr}, over the course of the
construction period are used to validate continuing compliance with
program requirements.

\subsection{Engineering Integration}

\dword{dune} \dword{tc} works with the collaboration to 
collect and validate requirements associated with the \dword{fd} 
modules.  Each detector module has its own set of high-level 
requirements with potential effects on the \dword{dune} physics 
program, which are owned by the \dword{dune} \dword{exb}.  The
\dword{exb} must approve any proposed changes to these 
requirements.  Lower-level technical requirements associated 
with each detector subsystem are developed by the consortia 
under the guidance of the \dword{tc} engineering support team.  
Appendix~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-requirements} contains tables 
summarizing the high-level requirements associated with each of 
the \dword{fd} modules.

Starting from these requirements, the \dword{tc} engineering team
responsible for detector integration works with the
\dword{dune} consortia to build and validate integrated detector
models from the designs of the individual subsystems.  The team
ensures that the detector subsystems fit together properly and 
that the fully assembled detectors meet structural requirements 
associated with all operational conditions (both warm and cold), as 
is discussed further in Chapter~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-sysengr}.  
The team is responsible for validating that the integrated detector 
designs satisfy the defined requirements needed to meet the goals 
of the \dword{dune} physics program.

Integration of the full detector models within the global model
encompassing the detector caverns and supporting infrastructure
is the responsibility of the central \dword{jpo} engineering 
integration team.  The \dword{tc} engineering team is responsible 
for validating interfaces within the combined model between 
\dword{dune} detector components and supporting infrastructure 
pieces.  All proposed changes to the global model require approval 
from the \dword{tcoord} based on guidance received from the lead 
engineers embedded within the \dword{tc} detector integration team.

As part of these efforts, the engineering team works 
with consortium leadership teams to develop controlled 
documents describing interfaces between the different detector 
subsystems.  These documents are placed under signature control 
within the \dword{lbnf-dune} document management system.  
Proposed changes to interface documents must be approved by 
the consortium leadership teams on both sides of the interface 
as well as by the lead engineers in the \dword{tc} 
detector integration team.

The \dword{tc} engineering team works with the
\dword{lbnf-dune} systems engineer, who heads the \dword{jpo} 
configuration and integration team, to develop required documents 
detailing interfaces between the \dword{lbnf} and \dword{dune} 
\dword{fd} construction projects and the interfaces of these 
projects with \dword{lbnf-dune} installation and integration
activities at \dword{surf}.  These \dword{lbnf-dune} interface 
documents are placed under signature control within the 
\dword{lbnf-dune} document management system and proposed 
changes require approvals from both the lead \dword{lbnf-dune} 
systems engineer and the responsible individuals associated 
with each branch of the global project (\dword{lbnf} project 
manager, \dword{dune} \dword {tcoord}, and \dword{ipd}).

Appendix~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-interface} contains a table 
cataloging the \dword{dune} interface documents 
and providing web links for accessing approved versions 
 in place at the time of the release of this document.
 
\subsection{Change Control and Document Management}
\label{sec:tc_change control}

The \dword{dune} project follows the \dword{lbnf-dune} change control
process described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-change} and
Section~\ref{sec:change-control}.  The decision path for changes not
impacting the \dword{lbnf} project or \dword{lbnf-dune} 
installation activities at \dword{surf} is self-contained within
the \dword{dune} collaboration management structure.  A hierarchy of
decision-making levels is defined based on pre-determined thresholds
related to the extent of the proposed change with the most significant
changes requiring \dword{dune} \dword{exb} approval.

For document management, the \dword{dune} construction project 
relies on the \dword{lbnf-dune} document management system 
administrated by the \dword{jpo} engineering integration team 
configuration manager.  \Dword{tc} works with the \dword{lbnf-dune} 
\dword{qa} manager to ensure that the information needed to track 
the history of each detector component through construction, 
assembly, and testing is properly captured within the PBS 
database.  A dedicated \dword{dune} \dword{qa} specialist 
sits within the \dword{tc} organization and coordinates the 
\dword{dune} \dword{qa} program under the direction of the
\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager.  The \dword{dune} 
\dword{qa} program is described in much greater detail in 
Chapter~\ref{vl:tc-QA}.
 
\subsection{Schedule}

The lead project controls specialist within the \dword{tc} team works
with the \dword{dune} consortia to build schedules covering
the design, testing, and construction activities associated with their
subsystems and incorporate these within the \dword{lbnf-dune}
schedule.  The project controls specialist communicates with consortia
technical leads on a monthy basis to track the status of activities
and update the \dword{lbnf-dune} schedule accordingly.  Milestones
positioned at regular intervals within the subsystem construction
schedules are incorporated to enable high-level tracking of these
efforts.  Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-controls} (in
Appendix~\ref{ch:tc-sp-project}) contains a table summarizing key
detector milestones around which the individual consortia
schedules are constructed.

\subsection{Risk Management}

\dword{dune} \dword{tc} maintains a global registry containing both
subsystem-specific risks identified by the consortia and self-held
risks associated with the overall coordination of the \dword{dune}
construction project as discussed in
Sections~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-risks}~and~\ref{sec:fdsp-app-risk}.  The
\dword{tcoord} uses Project Board Meetings to regularly review the
risk registery with the consortium leadership teams and define
mitigation actions as necessary to prevent identified risks from being
realized.  The \dword{tcoord} does not have control over
contingency funds held by the internal projects of the participating
funding agencies.  In cases of identified need, the \dword{tcoord}
works with the consortium leadership teams to implement risk
reduction strategies.  Identified issues that cross consortia
boundaries are discussed at project board meetings and brought to the
\dword{dune} \dword{exb} if they need to be addressed at a higher
level.

Appendix~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-risks} contains tables summarizing the 
highest-level identified risks within the \dword{tc} risk registry.

\subsection{Review Process}

The \dword{tcoord} has primary responsibility for conducting design 
and \dwords{prr} covering each detector subsystem.  As 
described in Section~\ref{sec:dune_review} and Chapter~\ref{vl:tc-review}, 
reviews are coordinated through the \dword{jpo} review planning team to 
ensure coherence in the review process across the entire \dword{lbnf-dune} 
enterprise.  The deputy \dword{tcoord} is the \dword{jpo} 
team member responsible for organizing the reviews.  The full review process is 
described in greater detail in Chapter~\ref{vl:tc-review}.

\section{\dshort{dune} Work Flow}
\label{sec:workflow}

Table~\ref{tab:responsibility} lists the time-ordered set of activities 
required to realize the \dword{dune} \dword{fd} modules, from the design 
of individual detector components through operation of the fully-assembled 
modules.  Primary responsibility for the detector subsystems is held 
by the \dword{dune} consortia over the full course of these activities.
\dword{dune} \dword{tc} under the direction of the \dword{tcoord} is 
responsible for coordinating the consortia efforts related to the design, 
prototyping, fabrication, and transport (to South Dakota) of the required 
detector elements.  Efforts related to the receipt (in South Dakota), 
processing, installation, and check-out of detector components are 
coordinated through the \dword{integoff} under the direction of the \dword{ipd} as 
described in Chapter~\ref{ch:tc-jpo}.  The \dword{integoff} also coordinates efforts 
related to the installation and commissioning of the supporting cryogenic 
infrastructure, for which the \dword{lbnf} project has %direct 
responsibility.  
The \dword{dune} collaboration takes responsibility for coordinating 
activities occuring after the cryostats are filled with liquid argon 
beginning with final commissioning of the detectors and continuing into 
long-term detector operation.

\end{dunetable}

Although the organizations responsible for coordinating activities during 
each stage of the time-ordered process required to bring the \dword{fd} 
modules online are clearly delineated in Table~\ref{tab:responsibility},
additional, important support roles are connected to each stage.  
The \dword{integoff} interacts with \dword{dune} \dword{tc} during detector design, 
prototyping, and construction to ensure that detector elements integrate 
properly within the supporting infrastructure.  Participation of the 
consortia in the planning process for integration and installation
activities at \dword{surf} is facilitated through \dword{dune} \dword{tc}.
The \dword{dune} collaboration also provides %direct 
support throughout 
the entire process.  The collaboration is responsibile for defining the 
\dword{dune} science program and performing the physics studies used to 
define detector requirements.  The collaboration also provides resources 
that support acquisition of common detector infrastructure items sitting 
outside the scope of the consortia as well as necessary personnel and 
equipment to support integration and installation efforts at \dword{surf}.

During each stage of the time-ordered process for implementing the 
\dword{fd} modules, issues may arise requiring high-level decisions 
on steps required for moving forward.  Table~\ref{tab:responsibility2} 
summarizes which body within the global project structure (\dword{dune}
\dword{exb} or \dword{efig}) takes responsibility for high-level 
decision-making during each stage of the \dword{dune} \dword{fd} 
construction project.  
         
The \dword{dune} project has already completed an initial round of design 
and prototyping activities culminating in the construction and operation 
of the \dword{protodune} detectors.  Moving forward, the project is 
updating detector component designs to account for lessons learned from 
the \dword{protodune} experience. Once the designs are final, the 
project will construct first production versions of all components that 
will be installed and operated in a second phase of \dword{protodune} 
operations prior to the start of full-scale production.  The operation 
of the \dword{protodune2} detectors will follow roughly two years after
the end of operations for the corresponding \dword{protodune} detectors.
In a few cases, the production of long lead-time components will need to 
be started in parallel with the operation of first production components 
in \dword{protodune2}.
