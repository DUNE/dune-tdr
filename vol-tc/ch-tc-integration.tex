%\section{Overview}
%\label{sec:fdsp-overview}

The \dword{dune} \dword{fd} % detectors 
consists of %\dword{dsp} and \dword{ddp} modules 
\dwords{spmod} and \dwords{dpmod}, 
which are housed inside cryostats, which in turn are housed
inside the \dword{lbnf} \dword{fscf}.
 This layered structure allows for carrying out
detector integration in a layered and hierarchical method. %In this
This chapter explains the method of integration for the \dwords{detmodule}.
 %isexplained.  
 The integration of the modules is carried out by the
\dword{tc} engineering team.

Integration engineering for \dword{dune} focuses on configuring the
mechanical and electrical systems of each \dword{detmodule} and managing
the interfaces within them. This includes verifying that subassemblies
and their interfaces are built conforming to the approved design,
e.g., \dword{apa} or \dword{sp} \dword{pds}. The second major focus
is assuring that the \dwords{detmodule} can be integrated and
installed into their final configuration. And the third major focus is
integrating necessary services provided by \dword{cf} 
with the \dwords{detmodule}.


To this end, the \dword{tc} engineering team maintains subsystem
component documentation in order to manage the detector
configuration. The consortia provide engineering data for their
subsystems to \dword{tc}. The \dword{tc} engineering team works with
the \dword{lbnf} project team and \dword{jpo} to integrate all detector
data into the global \dword{lbnf} configuration files.

This process is the same as was used for \dword{protodune}, which proved to be
successful. The process has been enhanced with the addition of engineering
and design staff and development of interface documents as described
in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-interface}. %later in this chapter. 

\section{Mechanical Integration Models}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-models}

The \dword{sp} and \dword{dp} \dwords{detmodule} are large and made of many
intricate components. Fortunately, for the most part, the
components are repetitive and not overly complex
geometrically. Thus, \threed mechanical modeling techniques are well suited
to represent the \dwords{detmodule} and manage their configuration.

At the same time, \threed modelling techniques vary in the way items are
represented and in the way the techniques are carried out. Thus, a set
of \twod integration drawings must be generated; these drawings must be
clear and unambiguous across the collaboration. Such \twod drawings are
the basis for the \threed model accuracy, as well as the basis for the engineering
design of all components.

The consortia choose the  mechanical modeling software that they use. %The mechanical modeling software used by the consortia is chosen by them. 
They transfer the model files %from consortia are transferred 
to \dword{tc} and \dword{jpo}
via STEP files, which the %Model files are integrated by 
\dword{jpo} integrates  into overall models
using Navisworks software. This allows for visualization by entire
collaboration.

\subsection{Static Models}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-static}

\dword{tc} generates and maintains \threed detector integration models as
well as \twod integration drawings. These models are static because they
represent all components at their design dimensions and
locations. They do not represent effects of gravity, tolerances, cold
temperature, and installation and assembly clearances. Such effects are
modeled in the envelope and assembly models, as described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-envelope}. %later in this chapter.


The \threed models are assembled by combining component models from various
consortia, %. The \threed model files are 
then shared with the consortia. The \twod integration drawings, which are generated from
the \threed models and disseminated, show the interfaces to the level of
detail necessary to ensure proper fit and function. Any issues that
arise are communicated to the consortia, and a resolution method is
determined. 

The \dword{tc} engineering team will not change any consortia
component models.  The consortia must resolve any issues using agreed-upon methods, and provide updated models for reintegration. Using this
process, models are kept synchronized with integration occurring in
only one direction: only the consortia modify their models, and the
\dword{tc} engineering team integrates and disseminates them.


The level of detail in a model is managed actively. When models are combined and 
incorporated into global models of facilities, too much
detail leads to very large file sizes.  The \dword{tc}
engineering team must ensure the appropriate level of detail at each
stage of model integration.


Figure~\ref{fig:dune-sp_overall} shows the overall model of the
\dword{spmod} with one wall of the cryostat  removed to make the
interior components visible. The detector has 25 rows, all of
which follow the same construction. At the ends of rows 1 and 25,
\endwall{}s are installed to close the detection volume.
\begin{dunefigure}[Overall model of the SP module]{fig:dune-sp_overall}
  {Overall model of the \dword{spmod} showing three of the 25 rows,
    simplified cryostat, \dword{dss} and temporary cryostat opening.}
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Overall_model_SP}
\end{dunefigure}
As mentioned earlier, this model does not include all the details of
the detector components. The components are simplified to keep the
overall model complexity to a manageable level.


Figure~\ref{fig:dune-sp_row} shows the model of one row of the
detector module. Each row is constructed from six \dword{apa}s, four
\dword{cpa}s and eight \dwords{fc} and \dwords{gp}. A total of 25 rows
comprise one \dword{spmod}.
\begin{dunefigure}[Model of one row of the SP module]{fig:dune-sp_row}

\end{dunefigure}


Figure~\ref{fig:dune-sp_transverse} shows a cross section of the
\dword{spmod} in the transverse direction and the overall
dimensions.

Figure~\ref{fig:dune-sp_long} shows a cross section of the
\dword{spmod} in the longitudinal direction and the overall
dimensions. In both figures, the cryostat structure and insulation are shown
as cross-hatched areas.

\end{dunefigure}



Figure~\ref{fig:dune-dp_overall} shows the overall model of the \dword{dpmod} with one wall of the cryostat  removed to
show the interior components. The detector has 20 rows, all of which
are constructed the same way. Each row comprises four \dwords{crp},
cathode, \dword{gp}, \dwords{pmt} and side-wall \dwords{fc}.  At the
end of row 1 and row 20, \endwall{}s are installed that close the
detection volume.

More detailed models of the \dword{dpmod} integration
interfaces are shown in the following figures.

\subsection{Envelope and Assembly Models}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-envelope}

Static models represent the \dword{detmodule} and its components using their exact
design dimensions. Such exact dimensions are needed so that the
detail component drawings and model remain completely compatible at all
times.


For installation and operation, however, other envelope models are
needed. Envelope models are developed to address issues that affect
installation and operation:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item effects on the detector caused by distortion of the cryostat
   and detector support structure due to gravity;
 \item effects on the detector caused by distortion of the cryostat
   and detector support structure due to loads on the cryostat during
   detector filling and operation;
 \item effects on the detector caused by thermal contraction during
   detector filling and operation;
 \item effects of component and
   assembly tolerances;
 \item clearances needed for installation and envelopes needed for
   access and tooling;
 \item reference models and drawings needed for installation stages
   and to control assembly; and
 \item reference models and drawings needed for alignment and survey.
\end{enumerate}


The models and drawings described above are generated from static
models. Models are also generated to represent combined effects of the
above. In all cases, as with static models, \twod drawings are created
and provide the basis for the installation drawings.


Generating envelope models and drawings are the responsibility of the
\dword{tc} engineering team in coordination with consortia.


\subsection{Integration and Interface Drawings}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-drawings}

Within each \dword{detmodule}, components from various consortia are
assembled and installed. In addition, components that are the
responsibility of \dword{tc} are also assembled and installed in
parallel. The interfaces among components are developed and managed
through models and drawings as described in
Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-models}. Many such interfaces must
be controlled to insure that the detectgor will fit together. The
following section shows some of the interfaces, control drawing,
dimensions, and configurations.


Figure~\ref{fig:dune-apa_interfaces_top} shows the interfaces for the
top \dword{apa}s in the upper corner of the cryostat. It also shows the position
of the cable penetration for the \dword{apa}. Interfaces with cryostat
corrugations and \dword{lar} fill lines are also shown. The reference plane,
defined as the plane of the \dword{apa} yokes, is explained in the
alignment section (Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-survey}).
\begin{dunefigure}[Interface between upper APA,
   FC, cable trays and DSS]{fig:dune-apa_interfaces_top}
  {\dword{spmod} interface between upper \dword{apa}, \dword{fc}, cable
    trays and \dword{dss}.}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Interface_upper_apa.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}


Figure~\ref{fig:dune-apa_interfaces_bottom} shows the interfaces for
the bottom \dword{apa}s in the lower corner of the cryostat. In both figures,
the connection latch between the \dwords{fc} and \dword{apa}s is also
shown.
\begin{dunefigure}[Interface between lower APA, FC
    and service floor]{fig:dune-apa_interfaces_bottom}
  {\dword{spmod} interface between lower \dword{apa}, \dword{fc} and 
    service floor.}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Interface_lower_apa.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}


Figure~\ref{fig:dune-apa_interfaces_mid} shows the interfaces for the
top of the central row of \dword{apa}s with other components. In this case, a
double latch connection is used. Similarly,
Figure~\ref{fig:dune-cpa_interfaces} shows the interfaces for top of the
\dword{cpa}s with other components.
\begin{dunefigure}[Interface between APA, upper FC 
    and GP]{fig:dune-apa_interfaces_mid}
  {\dword{spmod} interface between \dword{apa}, upper \dword{fc} and \dword{gp}}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Interface_upper_mid_apa.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}
\begin{dunefigure}[Interface between CPA, upper FC and GP]
    {fig:dune-cpa_interfaces}
  {\dword{spmod} interface between \dword{cpa}, upper \dword{fc} and \dword{gp}.}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Interface_upper_cpa.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}

These integration drawings are derived directly from the overall
integration model. The overall integration model is assembled from
component models developed by the consortia. Interfaces are controlled
by \dword{tc}, and consortia maintain their model files to be
compatible with the interfaces. During the design phase, models are
assembled and checked continuously. At the time of final design, all
interfaces will be finalized. 


Component tolerances and installation clearances are managed through
additional models as described in
Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-envelope}.
Figure~\ref{fig:dune-apa_envelope} shows the \dword{apa}s and
\dword{cpa}s as well as their relative positions that show how they are
constrained within the detector.
\begin{dunefigure}[Envelope dimensions and
    installation clearances for APAs and CPAs (warm)]
    {fig:dune-apa_envelope} {\dword{spmod} graphical
    representation of envelope dimensions and installation clearances
    for \dword{apa}s and \dword{cpa}s in the warm state.}
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Warm_envelope_dimensions.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}



Figure~\ref{fig:dune-apa_envelope} shows design dimensions. Component tolerances and assembly
tolerances for the upper and lower \dword{apa}s and \dword{cpa} stacks
have been analyzed and are represented as envelope dimensions. An envelope
gap has been defined to account for tolerances in the support system
position and among components. Taking all of these into account, pitch
distances for \dword{apa}s and \dword{cpa}s have been defined in the
warm state.

This figure %Figure~\ref{fig:dune-apa_envelope} 
also shows the design drift distance in
the warm state. The drift distance is defined as the perpendicular
distance between the surface of \dword{cpa}s and the collection wire
plane of \dword{apa}s.

\dword{apa}s and \dword{cpa}s are supported in groups of two or three
on \dword{dss} beams. Fifty beams are arranged into five parallel
rows with 10 beams in each row.  In the cold state, the relative
positions between groups of \dword{apa}s that are supported on
different beams change due to thermal contraction of the
beams. Relative positions within each group %which are 
supported on the
same beam are relatively constant since \dword{apa} frames and %sm chg anne
\dword{dss} are both made from stainless steel.  The effect is that the gap
in the active area between some \dword{apa}s increases.  As can be
seen in Figure~\ref{fig:dune-apa_aa_cold}, in the warm state, the gap
in the active areas between adjacent \dword{apa}s is 28 mm (dotted
line). In the cold state, nine of the 24 gaps increase to
approximately 45 mm.
\begin{dunefigure}[APAs active area gap in cold state]{fig:dune-apa_aa_cold} 
    {\dword{spmod} gap in active areas between adjacent \dword{apa}s in the cold state. Dashed line warm state, dots cold state.}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{apa_aa_gap_change.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}

The effects of gravity and buoyancy are not represented in the above
analysis. Such effects are under study and will be shown in the models
as design progresses.

Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:dune-floorpipes} shows the interface of the
cryostat service floor with other components.  Before installing the
\dword{detmodule}, a set of cryogenic distribution pipes are installed
on the floor of the cryostat. These as well as the corrugations of the
cryostat membrane would impede movement, hence the need for
a temporary service floor. It will be installed, and later removed, in sections. 
\begin{dunefigure}[SP module interface of cryogenics, service floor and detector]{fig:dune-floorpipes}

  detector.}

\end{dunefigure}

\subsection{Detector Survey and Alignment}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-survey}
%The detector placement within the cryostat inside the
%cavern does not have a physics requirement. 
The requirement for detector placement within the cryostat is driven
by overall mechanical assembly needs, rather than physics.  %so that 
Interfacing
parts %are 
must be assembled properly and function as intended.


In this section, reference frames for the detector are defined so that the
overall survey and alignment can be done within the cavern reference
frame. \forlbnc{Note: we have not yet defined this.}


For the \dword{spmod}, we define a flat and horizontal 
reference plane 
coplanar with the upper \dword{apa} yoke plane; i.e.,
75 yoke planes define this %flat and level reference 
plane. This
reference plane is set at exactly \SI{781}{mm} below the theoretical plane
of the cryostat top membrane.
\fixme{What is the importance of the apa yoke planes? (yoke plane = plane defined by the top of the apa yokes? No, it's plural. I'm lost.) And the ref plane is set there because that happens to be where the yoke planes are?  This pgraph could use a bit of clarification. anne}


The detector reference plane is coplanar with the upper \dword{apa}
yoke planes because all features, including the active area, are
referenced to this plane.  \fixme{sounds circular. anne} Once this reference plane is defined and
established through survey, all vertical distances within the detector
are referenced and established relative to it. % this plane.
Figure~\ref{fig:dune-apa_interfaces_mid} shows the reference plane in
relation to the cryostat top membrane and \dword{dss}.


During installation, the height of the \dword{dss} beams is set in
accordance with this relationship. Adjustments are made in the
\dword{dss} to ensure that all the beams are in the correct plane. The
combined effects of gravity, buoyancy, temperature and \dword{lar} mass after
fill are calculated, and further adjustments are made to
compensate. This will ensure that the detector is as close as possible
to design value after fill. \fixme{This will ensure that the \dword{tpc} position remains as close as possible to nominal after fill. ? anne}


The transverse position of the detector is constrained to the center
of the cryostat. Thus, the mid-plane of the middle row \dword{apa} is
coplanar with the vertical mid-plane of the cryostat. This
relationship is verified when the \dword{dss} beams and central row of
\dword{apa}s are installed. The outer rows are similarly aligned and
surveyed with the offset as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dune-sp_row}.
\begin{dunefigure}[Position of longitudinal
    reference point for the SP module]{fig:dss_feedthru}
  {Position of feedthrough determining the longitudinal reference point of the \dword{spmod}.}
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{SP_longitudinal_reference.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}


The longitudinal reference point of the detector within the cryostat
is defined by the position of the single feedthrough of the central row
farthest from the cryostat opening. This feedthrough position
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dss_feedthru}.


\forlbnc{Dual phase should be similar transversely and
longitudinally; vertically, it needs to be determined}




\section{Electrical Integration}
\label{sec:fdsp-Integ-electrical}



\subsection{Electrical System Block Drawings, Schematics, Layouts and Wiring Diagrams}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-electrical}


\dword{tc} is responsible for the AC power distribution supplied to
the experiment and to detector electronics racks.  This is described
in Sections~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-faci-grounding}
and~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-faci-power}.  Specific guidance has been
provided regarding the use of DC power supplies and cable shield
treatment.  These guidelines are specified in
EDMS-2095958\cite{bib:cernedms2095958}. They are the same as were
followed at \dword{protodune} and developed during extensive testing
of the \dword{apa} wire readout at \dword{bnl} and \dword{protodune}.
Guidelines are included for the treatment of DC power supplies and the
use and connection of shielded cables.  All systems are reviewed for
compliance to these guidelines during the design review procedure.
Any deviation from the guidelines must be noted and approved by system
engineering.

\dword{tc} will, through the design review process, ensure
that all electrical systems  follow safe design practice and
will pass \dwords{orr}.  \dwords{orr} will fall under the \dword{ahj} for the
underground facility.  Review by \dword{tc} will include
vetting of all power and ground paths, adherence to national
electrical standards or equivalents for all commercial equipment, and
adherence to the electrical design rules in the \dword{fnal} \dword{feshm} %FESH 
chapters.

The electrical design of each subsystem is described by a set of
documents that includes a system-level block diagram and a wiring
diagram that includes a complete description of all power and ground
connections.  Depending on what is being described, a complete set of
schematics, board production files and wiring diagrams will be
reviewed and archived.  All designs are subject to electrical safety
review, as described above, before production proceeds. The safety
reviews should begin through the \dword{tcoord} early in the design
process.



Consortia will produce system-level block diagrams. The \dword{tcoord}
will ensure that these diagrams are produced and reviewed.  In
some cases, multiple %system level block 
diagrams may be required, e.g., the %.  The slow controls 
\dword{cisc} consortium %is one example of this, with 
is responsible for several types of
systems (such as temperature readouts, purity monitors, cameras,
pressure sensors), each requiring a separate %system-level block
diagram. A system-level block diagram should show the conceptual
blocks required in the design along with connections to other
conceptual block elements, both inside and outside the given consortium.
Figure~\ref{fig:electrical_blockdiagram_example} shows an example of a
system-level block diagram.
\begin{dunefigure}[Sample system-level block diagram]{fig:electrical_blockdiagram_example}
  {Electrical system-level block diagram example (\dword{spmod} \dword{ce}).}
 \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Example_System_Level_Block-Diagram-SP_Cold_Electronics.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}


All consortia must provide an electrical wiring diagram that 
represents the power and ground distribution within the system being
described.  The paths of power and ground distribution wiring between
circuit elements are specified along with wire types and sizes.  Power
elements like power supplies, fuses (or other protective circuit
elements), power connectors, and pin and wire ampacity are documented.


Electrical schematics show very specifically how individual
components are connected.  Usually, a schematic will represent a
\dword{pcb} design.  Schematics call out specific
parts that are used in the design and include all interconnections.
In the case of a \dword{pcb}, layout files, manufacturing
specifications, and bills of materials document
the design and allow a safety review of any custom boards or
modules.


Wiring diagrams include all wire and cable connections that run
between \dwords{pcb} or electronics modules.  Wires and
cables are described within the diagram and include identification of
\dword{awg}, wire color, cable specification and
cable connectors and pinouts.





\subsection{Electrical Integration Documentation}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-electrical}

%Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-electrical} lists the documentation required to describe construction of a subsystem corresponding to the design responsibilities within a consortium.  
Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-electrical} lists the documentation a consortium must provide
to describe construction of a subsystem for which it is responsible. Interfaces that occur
between subsystems of different consortia must be documented and formally agreed
upon between the technical leads of the coordinating consortia and
must be verified by the \dword{tcoord} team.  Much of the
documentation required to describe a subsystem is also required for
integration. \fixme{the same doc can be used, or a similar set of doc is required for integ?}


Documentation required for the interface between two electrical
subsystems includes a block diagram that identifies all connections
between the subsystems.  This block diagram must exist in the formal
interface document between consortia.  For each connection, additional
documentation must fully describe the interface
details. This additional detailed information can exist outside of the
primary interface document between the consortia, but that document must point to it.


A signal cable that runs
between \dwords{pcb} belonging to different consortia is an example of an 
integration interface.  For
a signal cable, interface documentation includes the connector
specifications, pinouts at each end of the cable, and the pinout of the
board connectors.  Documentation would also describe 
relevant electrical signal characteristics that may include signal
levels, function, protocol, bandwidth and timing information.  If
%signals are referred to using different signal names between
%subsystems, 
different subsystems refer to a given signal by different names, 
documentation of signal name cross reference must be
provided.

Consortium technical leads and the \dword{tcoord} team must sign off
and approve the detailed documentation information on integration
interfaces not included in the primary consortium-to-consortium
interface document.

The \dword{tc} team will provide unique names and labels
for all racks, crates, boards, power supplies, cables and any other
electrical type equipment.  A database will be created to track these
devices.

\section{Configuration and Drawing Storage and Dissemination}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-modelplan}

The consortia and \dword{tc} engineering team create and share
drawings, models, schematics, production data and all other
engineering documents. In addition, the \dword{tc} engineering team
generates and shares all interface drawings and documentation.


Folders have been set up that allow uploading and sharing documents
with appropriate protection. The structure of the folders has been set
up to suit each consortium. The consortia do not necessarily have
similar folder structures or files, and will adapt the structure to fit
their needs.


The folders and files reside on the \dword{edms}. This system and
similar structures were used for \dword{protodune} and are being
used by \dword{lbnf}.


The following shows a high-level outline of the file structure. The
first section is for technical coordination files. The second
section is generic, intended for a consortium. Each consortium will have one such
folder.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \dword{tc}
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item mechanical drawings and files (controlled by \dword{dune} lead mechanical engineer)
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \dword{fd} general drawings for illustration (controlled by \dword{tcoord})
    \item \threed model files of internal detector for periodic upload to global model
    \item \twod interface drawing files
    \item alignment and survey files
    \item Ash River installation test facility files
    \item \dword{qa}/\dword{qc} files
    \item safety analysis and documentation

 \begin{enumerate}
   \item \threed model files
   \item \twod part drawing files
   \item production files
   \item general grounding diagrams

   \item \dword{pcb} components (one folder per component)
   \item cable components (one folder per component)
   \item power supply components (one folder per component)
 \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Organization of Interfaces and Interface Documents}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-interface}

%To manage interfaces within the detector and between the detector and 
%facilities, an overall integration mechanism has been developed in
%order to achieve an overall model.  
An integration mechanism has been developed to manage and create an overall model of interfaces both within a \dword{detmodule} and between a \dword{detmodule} and facilities,
The mechanism %consisting of defining 
defines integration nodes, which can be thought of as focus areas, as
explained below.  The \dword{jpo} engineering team carries out  and manages interfaces between the nodes.% are carried out and managed by the .


\begin{dunefigure}[Integration Nodes]{fig:integration_nodes}
  {Overall integration nodes and interfaces}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Integration_nodes.png}
\end{dunefigure}

Figure~\ref{fig:integration_nodes} shows the interfaces between the
detector and facilities. In this figure, within the cavern, items
provided by \dword{lbnf} are on the left and the items provided by
\dword{dune} are on the right. In addition, the \dword{tc} engineering
team integrates the \dword{daq} room in the \dword{cuc} and
surface control and network rooms. \fixme{prev sentence unclear - what does it mean to integrate these rooms? anne} Interfaces with \dword{lbnf} are
managed at the boundaries of each integration node. As an example, the
interface between \dword{lbnf} and \dword{dune} for the underground
\dword{daq} and control rooms are power, cooling water, data fibers
and cable penetrations at the room boundaries. \dword{dune} is responsible 
for implementing power,
cooling water, data, and signal cables, as well as integrating the
racks. % are the responsibilities of .


The integration nodes comprise the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Detector:} This consists of all \dword{tpc} elements within
  the \dword{lar}. Almost all consortia are involved in this
  integration task, which is mostly mechanical. Consortium engineering
  teams work directly with the \dword{tc} engineering team.  The
  primary interface is with \dword{dss} through hangers. Examples of
  interfaces within this node include: \dword{fc} connections to both
  \dword{cpa}s and \dword{apa}s, \dword{ce} and \dword{pd} cable

Interface documents are developed and maintained to manage the
interfaces %among 
between consortia and between %consortia 
each consortium and the  \dword{tcoord}. A
single document covers the interface between any two systems, so any
one system may have several interface documents. If no interface
exists the interface document is not needed. \fixme{prev sentence needed?} The
interface documents are managed by %relevant 
the appropriate consortium technical leads
and by \dword{tc} project engineers.

The content of interface documents varies depending on the type
of interface. However, the documents are intended to have
a common structure: %, defining the interfaces in these sections:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Definition: This section defines the interfacing systems.
 \item Hardware: In this section, the interfacing hardware components,
   electrical and mechanical, are defined in general terms. As an
   example, the \dword{apa} frame needs to support the \dword{pd}
   mounting brackets.
 \item Design: In this section, the dependencies in design
   methodology, sequence, and standards are described. As with the
   previous example, the design of the \dword{pd} mounting
   brackets depends on side tubes chosen for the \dword{apa}.
 \item Production: Component production and overall assembly is
   shared among interfacing systems. This section details who has what
   responsibilities.
 \item Testing: Like production, testing is a shared
   responsibility. In this section, responsibilities for testing and
   the required equipment are apportioned.
 \item Integration: The integration of systems into installable units
   before insertion into the cryostat is defined in this section. The
   location, methodology, tooling, and environment for integration are
   defined.
 \item Installation: Installation tasks and responsibilities, once
   installable units are assembled, are defined in this section. Any
   special transportation or installation tool or fixture is also
   defined.
 \item Commissioning: In this section, overall responsibilities for
   commissioning tasks are defined, and parameters are set.
 \item Appendices: Technical figures and interfaces should be included
   in this section in as much detail as necessary. Block diagrams that
   show interconnections and detailed documentation of each connection
   are needed.

The interface documents will be developed and modified during the
technical design period. At the time of this writing, not all
documents have been fully developed. Once the technical design is
finished, the interface documents will be placed under revision
control.

\section{Enginering Change Control}
\label{sec:fdsp-change}

Changes in design and fabrication requirements follow revision processes
for design and fabrication documents, per \fixme{individual consortium?} consortia practice,  while
ensuring appropriate levels of verification, review and approval %are done 
by the consortium %a

%Changes in design and fabrication requirements that involve
%interfaces among consortia and between consortia and \dword{tc} may be
%initiated and requested by consortia or \dword{tc}. Such changes are

\section{Value Engineering}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-ve}

Value engineering is the process of arriving at cost-effective
solutions to the technical challenges of building the \dword{dune}
detector. \dword{dune} value engineering builds on significant
developments in \dword{lar} detectors dating to the early 1970s,
especially the large \dwords{lartpc}: \dword{icarus} and
\dword{microboone}. Prototyping by both \dword{lbne} and \dword{lbno} has
significantly advanced the value engineering process, leading to
construction of the \dword{protodune} detectors. These detectors validate
\dword{dune} designs and confirm that the necessary performance is
met. Any significant departure from current designs must account for
the success of \dword{protodune}  and may require testing in a second
run of \dword{protodune}. \fixme{does ``account for'' mean explain why pdune's success isn't good enough?} 

The value engineering process is executed at both the consortium and
\dword{tc} level. For example, the \dword{apa} size has been optimized
over the last 10--15 years, using input from dimensions of the Ross
Shaft, shipping container size, and availability of high-quality long
stainless steel tubes from reliable vendors.  At this point, any
significant change to the \dword{apa} design would likely lead to new
and significant re-engineering costs.

Value engineering is ongoing at all stages of design and will continue
through the fabrication, assembly and installation phases. In
particular, during the fabrication and assembly stages, when labor costs
are relatively higher, it can result in significant cost savings. The
consortia and \dword{tc} are activley engaged and have the necessary
experience for this ongoing process.
