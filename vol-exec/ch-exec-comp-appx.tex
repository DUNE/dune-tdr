\section{Roles}
\label{appx:comp-roles}

This appendix lists \dword{dune} computing roles derived from a comparison with existing similar roles on the \dword{lhcb} experiment at \dword{cern}.  \dword{lhcb} is similar in size and data volumes to \dword{dune}.

\item {Central Services Manager and Operators - 1.5 FTE}
The site manager and operators are responsible for the central infrastructure and services of the \dword{dune} distributed computing infrastructure. This includes coordinating with the host laboratory for services provided to \dword{dune}. %The Site Manager and Operator roles accounts for 1.5 FTE.

\item {Distributed Production Manager - 0.5 FTE}
Distributed production managers are responsible for the set up, launch, monitoring, and finishing of processing campaigns executed on distributed computing resources for the experiment. Production management is necessary for data processing, Monte Carlo simulation, and working group productions.% The data processing production manager role for all production types accounts for 0.5 FTE.

\section{Specific Collaborative Computing Projects}
\label{ch:exec-comp-gov-coop}

The \dword{hep} computing community has come together to form a \dword{hsf}\cite{Alves:2017she} that, through working groups, workshops, and white papers, guides the next generation of shared \dword{hep} software.  %The \dword{dune} experiments time scale, particularly the planning and evaluation phase, is almost ideal for our contribution to reap benefits.  
The \dword{dune} experiment’s time scale, particularly the planning and evaluation phase, is almost ideal for the \dword{hsf} to develop effective contributions. Our overall strategy for computing infrastructure is to carefully evaluate existing and proposed field-wide solutions, to participate in useful designs, and to build our own solutions only where common solutions do not fit, and additional joint development is not feasible.   This section describes some of these common activities. 



\subsection{LArSoft for Event Reconstruction}

Several neutrino experiments using the \dword{lartpc} technology share the \dword{larsoft}\cite{Snider:2017wjd} reconstruction package.  \dword{microboone}, \dword{sbnd}, \dword{dune}, and others share in developing a common core software framework customized for each experiment. This software suite and earlier efforts in other experiments made the rapid reconstruction of the \dword{pdsp} data possible.  \dword{dune} will contribute heavily to  the future evolution of this package, in particular, by introducing full multi-threading to allow parallel reconstruction of parts of large events, thus anticipating the very large events expected from the full detector. 

\subsection{WLCG/OSG and the HEP Software Foundation}
The  \dword{wlcg}\cite{Bird:2014ctt} organization, which combines the resource and infrastructure missions of the \dword{lhc} experiments, has proposed a governance structure that splits dedicated resources for \dword{lhc} experiments from general middleware infrastructure used to access those resources.  This \dword{sci} is already used by many other experiments worldwide.  In a white paper submitted to the European Strategy Group in December 2018\cite{bib:BirdEUStrategy}, a formal \dword{sci} organization is proposed. As part of the transition to that structure, the \dword{dune} collaboration was provisionally invited to join the \dword{wlcg} Management Board as observers and participate in the Grid Deployment Board and task forces. Our participation allows us to contribute to technical decisions on global computing infrastructure while also contributing to that infrastructure. 
Many of these projects also involve contributions to and from the broader \dword{hep} Software Foundation efforts. 

Areas of collaboration are described in the following sections. 

\subsubsection{Rucio Development and Extension}

 \dword{rucio}\cite{Barisits:2019fyl}
is a data management system originally developed by the \dword{atlas} collaboration and is now an open-source project.  \dword{dune} has chosen to use \dword{rucio} for large scale data movement.  Over the short term, it is combined with the \dword{sam} data catalog used by \dword{fnal} experiments.  \dword{dune} collaborators at \dword{fnal} and in the UK are actively collaborating on the \dword{rucio} project, adding value for \dword{dune} but also for the wider effort.


The global \dword{rucio} team now includes \dword{fnal} and \dword{bnl} staff, \dword{dune}, and \dword{cms} collaborators, as well as the core developers on \dword{atlas} who initially wrote \dword{rucio}.  Consortium members have begun collaborating on several projects:  (1) making object stores (such as Amazon S3 and compatible utilities) work with \dword{rucio} (a large object store in the UK exists for which \dword{dune} has a sizable allocation);  (2) monitoring  and administering the \dword{rucio} system, leveraging the landscape system at \dword{fnal}; and  (3) designing a  data description engine that can be used to replace the \dword{sam} system we now use.



\dword{rucio} has already proved a powerful and useful tool for moving defined datasets from point A to point B.  Our initial observation is that \dword{rucio} is a good solution for file localization but does not have the detailed tools for data description and granular dataset definition available in the current \dword{sam} system.  The rapidly varying conditions in the test beam show we need a sophisticated data description database interfaced to \dword{rucio}'s location functions. 

In addition, \dword{lhc} experiments such as \dword{atlas} and \dword{cms} work with disk storage and tape storage that are independent of each other.  This is unlike the dCache model used in most \dword{fnal} experiments where most of dCache is a caching front end for a tape store.  Efficient integration of caching into the \dword{rucio} model will be an important component for \dword{dune} unless we can afford to have most data on disk to avoid staging.

\subsubsection{Testing New Storage Technologies and Interfaces}

The larger \dword{hep} community\cite{Berzano:2018xaa} currently has a \dword{doma} task force
 with which several \dword{dune} collaborators are involved. There are task forces for authorization, caching, third party copy, hierarchical storage, and quality of service. All are of interest to \dword{dune} because they will determine the long term standards for common computing infrastructure in the field. 
In particular, the authorization issues should significantly affect \dword{dune}; they are covered in Section~\ref{ch-comp-auth}.


\subsubsection{Data Management and Retention Policy Development}



A data life cycle is built into the \dword{dune} data model.  Obsolete samples (old simulations and histograms and old commissioning data) need not be maintained indefinitely.  
We are organizing the structure of lower storage, so the various retention types are stored separately for easy deletion when necessary.  

\subsubsection{Authentication and Authorization Security and Interoperability}\label{ch-comp-auth}

Within the next few years, we expect the global \dword{hep} community to change significantly the methods of authentication and authorization of computing and storage. 
Over that period, \dword{dune} must collaborate with the USA and European \dword{hep} computing communities on improved authentication methods  that will allow secure but transparent access to storage and other resources such as logbooks and code repositories.  The current model, where individuals must be authenticated through different mechanisms for access to USA and European resources, is already a bottleneck to efficiently integrating personnel and storage. 
Current efforts to expand the trust realm between \dword{cern} and \dword{fnal} should allow a single sign-on for each to access the other laboratory.


\subsection{Evaluations of Other Important Infrastructure}

The \dword{dune} \dword{csc} is still evaluating major infrastructure components, notably databases, and workflow management systems.

For databases\cite{Laycock:2019ynk}, the \dword{fnal} conditions database is being used for the first run of \dword{protodune}, but the Belle II\cite{Ritter:2018jxh} system supported by \dword{bnl} is being considered for subsequent runs. 

For workflow management, we are evaluating \dword{dirac}\cite{Falabella:2016waj} and plan to investigate PANDA\cite{Megino:2017ywl} to compare with the current GlideInWMS, HT Condor, and POMS solution that has been successfully used for the 2018 \dword{protodune} campaigns.
Both \dword{dirac} and PANDA are used by several \dword{lhc} and non-\dword{lhc} experiments and are already being integrated with \dword{rucio}.
