CONVENTIONS:

5235, Please follow these (Instructions and reference info goes to about line 80 
in this file; please read through it before adding citations!

 - When adding citations to this file, if possible, copy the BibTeX rendering 
 of the citation from http://inspirehep.net. 

 - Many citations already exist in the file citedb.bib, also under the "common" 
 directory. It has entries from the CDR, the protoDUNE-SP TDR and possibly other
 documents. You can search it to see if the citation you want is there.

 - List DocDB notes like the following for non-publically viewable documents:

@techreport{bib:docdbNNNN,
title = "{DUNE FD Interface Document: SP TPC Electronics to joint DAQ}",
author = {Christian, D. and Karagiorgi, G. and Newbold, D. and
Verzocchi, M.},
type = {DUNE doc or LBNF doc},
number = {NNNN},
year = {2018},
note = "\url{https://docs.dunescience.org/cgi-bin/private/ShowDocument?docid=NNNN&asof=2019-11-1}"
}

- For publically viewable documents, use a different URL template:

@techreport{bib:docdbNNN,
title = "{DUNE FD Interface Document: SP TPC Electronics to joint DAQ}",
author = {Christian, D. and Karagiorgi, G. and Newbold, D. and
Verzocchi, M.},
type = {DUNE doc or LBNF doc},
number = {NNNN},
year = {2018},
note = "\url{http://docs.dunescience.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=NNNN&asof=2019-11-1}"
}

- List CERN EDMS notes as follows:

@techreport{bib:cernedmsNNNN,
          title = "{}",
          author = {},
          type =   {CERN EDMS},
          number = {NNNN},
          year =   {},
          note = "\url{https://edms.cern.ch/document/NNNN}"
}

@BOOK{strunk,
   author = {Strunk, Jr., William and E. B. White},
   title = "{The Elements of Style}",
   publisher = {Macmillan},
   edition = {Third},
   year = 1979
   }

@techreport{tdr-vol-1,
title = "{TDR Volume 1: The LBNF and DUNE Projects}",
collaboration = {{DUNE}},
year = {2019},
note = "\url{http://docs.dunescience.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=nnnn}"
}
	   
To make anything literal, surround it in {}'s.

A note on comments:  
 - EVERYTHING outside of an "at" block is a comment.
 - You can comment out an "at" block by deleting the "at" character.
 - Do not put any type of comments inside an "at" block. They are not allowed.

The order of citations in this file does not matter.                  
                  
A note on authors:

 - Spell out the full names and separate them with  the word "and".  If the 
 author list is too long to write everyone then end it with "and others" -- 
 NOT "et al".  The style will take care of things like only showing first initial 
 and changing "and others" to "et al".  

For help with bibtex see:

  abstract={This paper describes the design and construction of the MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber and associated systems. MicroBooNE is the first phase of the Short Baseline Neutrino program, located at Fermilab, and will utilize the capabilities of liquid argon detectors to examine a rich assortment of physics topics. In this document details of design specifications, assembly procedures, and acceptance tests are reported.}
